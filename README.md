# Frog Dataset
Dataset of frogs on a white background for ML experiments

* Probably includes some duplicate images
* Some of the images are of toads and not frogs!

Includes a preprocessing script that does the following:
* Makes the background of the images pure white
* Trims the empty whitespace so that the frog fills the frame
* Resamples the image to a target size (64x64 by default)
