# Frog Dataset
Dataset of frogs on a white background for ML experiments

![Sample](sample.png?raw=true "Sample Images")

* Probably includes some duplicate images
* Some of the images are of toads and not frogs!

Includes a preprocessing script that does the following:
* Makes the background of the images pure white
* Trims empty whitespace so that the frogs fill the frame
* Resamples the images to a target size (64x64 by default)
